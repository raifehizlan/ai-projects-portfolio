    description:
      "This project features a pretrained deep learning model tailored for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in the healthcare domain. It extracts structured medication-related information from unstructured clinical texts such as patient reports. The model identifies entities like drug names, dosages, durations, routes of administration, and adverse drug events (ADEs). It is ideal for clinical data analysis, and downstream NLP tasks in biomedical and pharmaceutical contexts",

      "This model is particularly useful for Clinical NLP researchers aiming to perform benchmarking or conduct comparative studies. It also serves HealthTech developers looking to integrate advanced NER capabilities into electronic health records (EHR), pharmacy management sysresult tems, or mobile health applications. Additionally, data scientists in the pharmaceutical industry can leverage this model for analyzing drug usage patterns and monitoring adverse drug events (ADEs)",
